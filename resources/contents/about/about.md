## Work experience

I started working as a professional web designer and web developer at very young ages. When I was 14 I had my first client jobs and in 2008, at the age of 16, I founded my first own company for web design and development. Since then I have worked with several clients doing quite a wide range of tasks.

After my BSc. in Computer Science in 2014, I decided to set my main focus more on developments and spend only little on design. Now I'm mainly working as a web developer on Laravel (PHP), Vue and React (JavaScript) projects.

### Specialization

It took me quite a while to realize that it's better to be a specialist instead of a generalist. On the other side I'm interested in many aspects of tech and web.

In 2014 I shifted more towards **PHP with Laravel** and **JavaScript (ES2015+) with Vue and React**. That's my specialization as a developer.

Additionally I am focused on the aspect of requirements engineering. My bachelor thesis at university was about **goal driven requirements engineering**. I adopted this method to use it for the whole aspect of running a business to make it profitable as soon as possible.

Last but not least, I read a lot about **AI and Machine Learning**. I'm not that far that I would call me pro in this field, but it is a goal to get more into the field.

## Portfolio

Here are some open sourced projects I actively work on:

- [`aheenam/mozhi`](https://github.com/Aheenam/mozhi) is a Laravel package that contains a simple implementation of a Markdown-file-based CMS.

- [`aheenam/laravel-package-cli`](https://github.com/Aheenam/laravel-package-cli) is a generator that scaffolds a Laravel package project. Just run a single command to get a full starting point for your next Laravel package.

- [`rathesDot/rathes.de`](https://github.com/rathesDot/rathes.de) is the source code for my personal website at [rathes.de](https://rathes.de). (If you are reading this online, you are probably on this website already).
