This page will tell you what I am focussed on at this current point of my life. I will do my best to update it as often as my path changes. You can also use this page as some kind of replacement for the more personal "About me" page as it will reflect my hobbies and interests. If you check out the history of this content page on [GitHub](https://github.com/rathesDot/rathes.de), you can even follow how my interests change over the months.

## Life

After almost half a year now in Ghent, I'm entirely used to this city. There are still some spots to explore and visit, but all in all Ghent doesn't feel like a new place anymore. Life is now way more structured than a few weeks ago and I'm happy about how my day to day life goes. Also, when driving back to Germany a few times, I realized that I absolutely do not miss that country.

As it is always the case, I'm still in the process of making my apartment something that people could call a home. It will probably take another six months I guess. The living room is still hasn't anything except for a couch and a dining table, things are still on the floor, but I'm making progress. The kitchen (as usual for me) is ready, but I'm sure that I will be able to setup the rest in the upcoming months as well.

## Reading & Writing

I'm still not that far that I can read a book every single month, but I make some little progress. I finished two of three books from my previous update. And I also read another book (a technical one). So in the upcoming weeks I will keep up reading

1. **[A Fortune-Teller Told Me: Earth-bound Travels in the Far East](https://amzn.to/2T3IewH)** by Tiziano Terzani

that I already started but haven't finished yet. But I also started

2. **[Hollow City](https://amzn.to/2PnBEmf)** by Ransom Riggs

Last year around this time I read the first part (Miss Peregrineâ€™s Home for Peculiar Children) and I really loved it. So finally I'm continuing with the sequel.

Last book that I started reading is

3. **[Computational Intelligence: Probleme, Methoden und technische Anwendungen](https://amzn.to/2PQfd8F)** by Andreas Kroll

My brother actually bought this, since it is written by his professor. But since he finished and I'm also interested in that topic, I'm going to give it a try as well.

My writing isn't that sucessful as the reading. At least for the crime novel. It is barely making any progress and it is really frustrating. So for now I just skipped it and only write down some brainstorms that I have from time to time.

But instead I started writing my Tamil Grammar book. I started writing some kind of a textbook for my Tamil app and people asked me to publish this as a book as well. I really liked the idea, so I started writing it down. The structure is done, the first chapters are as well and I also started working out the strategy how I want to publish the book.
My goal is to publish the book on my own (by Aheenam) and give it away for as less money as possible. I still need some strategy for that, but that is something that I should worry about only as soon as I reach the final stages of writing.

## Fitness

This part will be the saddest of this times update. I did really well when I started running. I reached a point where 10 miles (16km) were doable for me and even in an acceptable time. I was almost thinking of joining the Ghent marathon for the half marathon, but then in the middle of a run my knee started hurting. And until now it hasn't stopped.

So right now I'm pausing from any activity that makes my knee recovering slower. But I expect to join the gym during this month and slowly start again. (The outdoor season has ended for me though).

## Learn & Side-Projects

I actually started learning Dutch. Not on a regular base and not in class, but still. I can already understand things that I read in Dutch and I also understand a few things when people speak. Sometimes I'm also able to answer in Dutch. But I still do not know enough grammar and my vocabulary is too small to have proper conversations in Dutch. So by learning Dutch grammar and words, I hope to fix this issue. (Which isn't actually an issue since everybody speaks acceptable English)

As mentioned above I'm working on a Tamil Grammar book as a first step towards the Tamil App. I'm spending most of the time in getting this done in time. All the other side projects and ideas have to wait.
