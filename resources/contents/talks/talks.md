# Talks

In January 2019 I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few more talks, not only about tech-related stuff but also about society related things as I did a few times in the past already.

If you want me to give a talk at your meetup, conference or even private events, feel free to message me.
