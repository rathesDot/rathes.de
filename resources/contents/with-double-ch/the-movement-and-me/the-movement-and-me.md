The movement and me
===

The last days I spent a great amount of time thinking about this specific topic. People who do not know me that much often think that I’m not part of the Tamil movement. And I’m absolutely okay with that. Compared to those days back in 2008/2009, I’m quite quiet now.

As I already described, it took me a long time to feel as a Tamil, when I was younger. During my childhood I did my best to get accepted as a German. Only since the age of 12 or 13 I became aware of what it means to be a Tamil and I started being proud of it.

And then during the years of 2007-2009, I became a fanatic. I even had the idea of running away from home and joining the Tamil forces.

When I got involved in the movement of liberation for the Tamils, I had no idea of it. I had a basic idea of what Eelam was as a geographical area. I had an idea of the people involved in the struggle and a basic reason on why we would fight for Eelam.

For the rest? I had no idea. I would just follow the older people and it was always good to me what they did. When they said, X was okay, it was okay. When they said, we have to do Y, I would join them. I never questioned anything and I never asked myself what the result of my actions would be.

The result, you know it. After 2010 I spent a long time climbing out of a bottomless black hole of depression, while I kept acting as the strong and happy person as I have been until then. My mom always says that I reached full adulthood as soon as I became 18, still not knowing what I had to go through.

So after that until this day I spent my time on working on the mistakes I did earlier. I studied the entire history of the Tamil Tigers, trying to learn their philosophy and their vision (not the one that is taught by diaspora uncles) of a Tamil Eelam.

I analyzed the life of S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, known as "Thanthai Chelva", with the result of him becoming a bigger role model for me than even Prabhakaran.

I even studied the situation of the Tamils during the British colonies. And there is still a lot more political knowledge I have to gain.

On the other hand, I spent time on studying the Tamils. We know that the caste system still rules the Tamil community (even in the diaspora) but barely anyone knows that the system was not made by Tamils themselves.

Also, apart from the castes there is a lot more that separates Tamils.

There is a huge gap between the basic Tamil people and the educated elitists with both groups having a different idea of freedom. There is a gap between the diaspora Tamils and those who still have to suffer back in the homelands. There is a gap between the older generation and the ones who grew up in violence and war. There is even a gap between people from the Eastern and Northern provinces in the country.

So I spent a lot of time trying to understand the different minds of our people. This gave me an idea of in which part of the movement I want to act.
That is not the political one. There are a lot of young women and men that are really skilled in politics. There are a lot of Tamil youths with focus on accounting for the past and even more focusing on the political future of our people.

What I want to step in is the issue within our society. Caused by the war and the colonization before, the Tamil society missed the part of developing themselves.

Instead, everybody had their own interpretation of Nationalism with the result of a broken society. I want to tackle this issue. Educating the people and bring them together to have the same vision on freedom.

Educating them does not mean that the uneducated people are my goal. As I already said, there are a lot of Tamil that don’t understand each other. My goal is to connect them and make them a single nation again.

The last thing I want is that we reach the goal of an own state and then have another war because the people don’t understand each other.
