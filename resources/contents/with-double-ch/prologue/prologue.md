Prologue
===

One of the main aspects that runs like a golden thread through my whole life is people asking me how to spell my name. Actually it is not even my name, but the name of my father which for the western culture is also my last name:

*Sachchithananthan*

So I always end up spelling my name. And it always goes as following.

"S - A - C -H - C - H"

"Excuse me, with double 'CH'?

"Yes, with double CH"

So as this conversation has been following me through my entire life and as I'm pretty sure it will keep following me in the future as well, I chose this question as the title for this collection of writings.

Most of these writings are about incidents that happend in my life and made me taking the path that I'm going right now. Others are simply thoughts I had once and I wrote down just get them out of my head.

I'm absolutely not good at writing, you might have recognized it (otherwise you will do if you continue reading). But writing was and still is the best way of therapy for me. Whenever I'm stuck in a thought and it keeps me from doing anything else, I start writing it down on the medium that is near to me: Digital on my smartphone or notebook and analogue in my diary or simply on a loose collection of printing paper.

So now I'm really collecting these thoughts and try to put them together and publish them. I'm not trying to polish them, but I try to organize them giving them some kind of a title and I also try to sort them by the date I did write them.

You might ask yourself: "Why the hell do you publish them now?" There are two major reasons. First one is that I once had collected them already but somehow managed to lose the file. So half of my writing during the time from 2013 to 2015/2016 are gone. Publishing them would make sure that I won't lose them again so easily - the www never forgets.

The second reason is far more important. I've gone through really shitty times and for a long time I did not speak about it to anyone. That really brought me to really bad conditions. Luckily I realized that I have to talk, that I have to share my thoughts with somebody if I don't want them to destroy me. Now, a few years later, I've found a way to live with the everything that happend.

At the same time I see people and talk to them, who are in the same situation as I have been, who are bottling up all their thoughts and feelings. By sharing my sometimes very private thoughts, I want to encourage them to do the same. I want to let them know that talking to others will be helpful and sharing those thoughts can be relieving.

So this collection of writings will not be that interesting for everyone, but for those who are interested in the following topic:

How a son of two Tamil refugees handles life in the Western world when at the same time he is homesick for a country in which he has never stayed for longer than six weeks.

That means stories about a brutal state of Sri Lanka and how I personally was affected by the war, stories about being treated everywhere as a foreigner and also stories of my dream of pushing the Tamil society into a new generation.
